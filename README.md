# Technical Approach
Since its formation in 2008, [The iFish Group (IFG)](https://www.ifishgroup.com/) has had a long, successful history of developing and delivering Information Technology solutions for State of California clients. For this prototype, IFG used an Agile approach utilizing User-Centered Design (UCD) techniques and tools and the U.S. Digital Services Playbook methodology. Documents pertaining to the development process are published in the [Docs](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/tree/master/docs) directory within the IFG project’s GitHub repository.

Goals: To build a collaborative IFG team comprised of business, project, technical, and development resources to produce quality working software designed and built through continuous customer/user input and feedback throughout the development of the prototype and to deploy the solution using Agile DevOps best practices. 
Digital Services Playbook: We executed [13 plays](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/All13Play-collage.PNG): [1](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2001.jpg), [2](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2002.jpg), [3](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2003.jpg), [4](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2004.jpg), [5](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2005.jpg), [6](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2006.jpg), [7](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2007.jpg), [8](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2008.jpg), [9](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2009.jpg), [10](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2010.jpg), [11](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2011.jpg), [12](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2012.jpg), [13](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2013.jpg).

* **Frontend and Backend Web Developer:** Ernie Lopez
* **Interaction Designer/User Researcher/Usability Tester:** Max Mathews
* **Scrum Master/Agile Coach:** Hiren Vashi (Agile-related certifications: AgilityHealth Facilitator, ICP-ACC, SPC4, CSP, CSM, and PMI-ACP) 

## c. Understanding What People Need
Following [Play 1](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Play%2001.jpg) and User Centered Design techniques mentioned below, we identified users, proxy user personas, and their user stories and tested the prototype. Users participated in demos and provided feedback throughout to clarify the goals, needs, and behaviors of the system. We also utilized qualitative data (user groups, interviews, questionnaires) and quantitative data (bug reports and issues reported during demos) to identify user needs. 

## d. User Centered Design Techniques and Tools
IFG followed an Agile incremental and iterative development methodology utilizing the following User-Centered Design (UCD) techniques and tools:
1. [Participatory Design](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-d-1-UCD-Participatory%20Design.PNG): We used the participatory design process to design the solution. Participants included the entire Development team and additionally identified keen users who provided their initial views/opinions regarding the design creation.
2. [User Personas](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-d-2-UCD-User%20Personas.pdf): We developed personas for our user base, allowing a common understanding of final INSIGHT product users. We posted our personas in our team development room to further assist us in our product development.
3. [Persona Development and Empathy Mapping](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-d-3-UCD-Persona%20Development%20Brain%20Storming.jpg): Using brain-storming techniques at an all-team persona development session, we created personas within an hour. This activity revealed the underlying “why” behind users’ actions, allowing us to proactively design for their real needs.
4. [User Story Map](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-d-4-UCD-User%20Story%20Map.jpg): Based on goals identified for each persona and by mapping our user journey, we identified how each persona would use the application. We developed many user stories for each persona and ordered them based on the user-set priority. This helped in scoping/planning our project and in identifying the Minimum Viable Product.
5. [User Stories](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-d-5-UCD-User%20Stories.PNG): For each persona, we developed user stories by focusing on small and immediate customer needs and prioritizing them accordingly. We broke down user needs into small features that we could implement and easily deliver in few hours to few days.
6. [Wire Frames](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-d-6-UCD-Wire-frames.PNG): To record user experience and quickly visualize it, we sketched out initial wireframes.
 
## e. GitHub Repository
IFG‘s GitHub repository to document code commits and publish software is located at:
* https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt

## f. RESTful API Documentation
IFG used Swagger to document all RESTful APIs. The Swagger documentation is available at:
* http://insight.ifglabs.com/api/docs

## g. Section 508 and WCAG 2.0
INSIGHT is designed to meet and exceed accessibility guidelines to ensure access for people with physical, sensory, or cognitive disabilities. This includes adherence to Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Web Content Accessibility Guidelines standards, in accordance with the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov). IFG used the [Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool](http://wave.webaim.org/) to [assess compliance](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-g-508Com-Prod.png).

## h. Design Style Guide and Pattern Library
To construct/develop the application, IFG employed a combination of the [U.S. Web Design Standards](https://standards.usa.gov/) and [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) themes and templates. Bootstrap is an HTML5, CSS3, and JS framework for developing responsive projects compatible with desktop/mobile environments.
 
## i. Performed Usability Tests with People
Users had weekly application development process participation – attending product demonstrations during Sprint reviews and performing usability testing. Users provided qualitative feedback including usability, intuitiveness, usefulness, and overall experience. We integrated feedback and informed the subsequent versions of the prototype.

## j. Iterative Approach
During INSIGHT prototype application development, the team used an Agile incremental and iterative development methodology. IFG’s resident Enterprise Agile Coach, Hiren Vashi, guided the team’s approach and process. 
1. Day One: Team developed a [timeline](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-1-timeline.jpg) for [iterative timeboxes](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-1-Iterative%20TimeBoxes-Release%20Information%20and%20Metrics.pdf) and divided work effort into timeboxes.
2. First Iteration, Sprint 0: We set up [workspace](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-WorkSpace.jpg), supplies, and communication tools; developed [product vision](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-Product%20Vision%20Statement.jpg), [user personas](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-Personas%20on%20the%20wall.jpg), and [user activity flow](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-User%20Activity%20Flow.jpg); and derived an initial set of [user stories](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-User%20Stories.png). The team also collected business values for each, developed an initial product backlog set, divided the backlog set into releases on the [user story map](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-User%20Story%20Map.PNG), and set up a team collaboration tool, [CA Agile Central](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-2-CA%20Agile%20Central.PNG).
3. Remaining Sprints 1,2, and 3: The team designed and developed our INSIGHT product, using [pair programming](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-3-Pair%20Programming.png). 
4. Each Sprint: We performed the following [ceremonies](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-ceremonies.pdf): 
   - [Sprint Planning](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-a-Sprint%20Planning.jpg) – Team sessions to commit to completion of a set of the highest-ranked product backlog items. Here we decided our [Sprint Goals](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-a-Sprint%20Goals.jpg), developed the Sprint Backlog, and estimated user stories using [planning poker](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-a-Planning%20Poker.jpg).
   - [Daily Standups](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-b-Daily%20Standups.jpg) – Brief meetings for all team members to update each other with vital information for project coordination
   - [Product Backlog Grooming](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-c-Product%20Backlog%20Grooming.jpg) – Periodically performed to prioritize/estimate user stories in product backlog
   - [Sprint Review](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-d-Sprint%20Review.png) – To provide users and stakeholders with working software demonstration and to gather immediate feedback 
   - [Sprint Retrospectives](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/Section-j-4-e-Sprint%20Retrospectives.png) – Team noted what worked well and what could be improved.

## k. Responsive Multi-Device Design
Responsive design is a web page creation approach that uses flexible layouts, flexible images, and cascading style sheet media queries. Its goal is to build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size/orientation and accordingly change the layout. INSIGHT was created to work on multiple devices and presents a responsive design. We successfully tested it on Google Chrome, Windows Edge, Safari on iPad/iPhone, and Chrome for Android on mobile devices.

## l. Open-Source Technologies
IFG utilized more than five (5) modern and open-source technologies which include:

* **Server Frameworks:** [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), [Express](https://expressjs.com/), [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/)
* **Continuous Integration or Continuous Delivery:** [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/), [Packer](https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html), [Terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose), [Docker Swarm](https://github.com/docker/swarm)
* **Monitoring:** [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana), [Logstash](https://github.com/elastic/logstash), [Weave Scope](https://github.com/weaveworks/scope), [Elastic Search](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch), [Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus)
* **Source Control:** [GitHub](https://github.com/)
* **IDE:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The [code flows](https://github.com/ifishgroup/pqvp-kmt/blob/master/docs/PQVP%20-%20INSIGHT%20GitHub%20Repository.pdf) from UI Front End Frameworks/Toolsets, to Server Frameworks, to REST services documented in Swagger, to the Database layers are included in the GitHub repository.

## m. Flexible Hosting Environment
Our services are deployed on a flexible hosting environment (IaaS and PaaS) where resources can be provisioned in real time to meet traffic and user demand spikes. The prototype was deployed into [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), an Infrastructure as a Service and Platform as Service provider, using public utility-based cloud Infrastructure leveraging containerization by deploying all services as Docker containers to a Docker Swarm cluster hosted in AWS.

## n. Automated Unit Testing
Automated Unit Testing (AUT) is a software testing method in which units of code are rigorously checked to ensure that they correctly function. We performed AUT using Jest Testing Framework for backend restful API and frontend UI components.

## o. Continuous Integration
Continuous Integration (CI) is a development practice that requires Developers to integrate code into a shared repository several times daily. An automated build verifies each check-in, allowing early problem detection. We accomplished CI using Docker, Jenkins, and Terraform.

Jenkins is a leading open-source automation server that provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying, and automating any application. We used this platform to automate testing and continuous code deployment to the cloud provider.

Terraform is an infrastructure-as-code software that allows users to define a datacenter infrastructure in a high-level configuration language from which it can create an execution plan to build the infrastructure in a service provider platform such as AWS or Google Cloud.

## p. Configuration Management
Configuration Management refers to the process by which all artifacts relevant to a project, and the relationships between them, are stored, retrieved, uniquely identified, and modified. We utilized Configuration Management to ensure INSIGHT product integrity and managed the entire system with techniques such as immutable and declarative infrastructure. Tools included Packer, Terraform, AWS, Docker, Docker Swarm, Git, and Jenkins to facilitate changes and deployments to production. Servers are preconfigured using Packer to build AMIs with dependences such as Docker engines already included. We used Terraform to provision infrastructure in AWS and configure the initial Docker Swarm cluster. Docker containers are built and published to a Docker hub that contains configuration details for our services and applications. Docker Swarm is used to orchestrate deployments to the cluster. All operational changes are made using Git and executed via Jenkins.

## q. Continuous Monitoring
Continuous Monitoring is the process of measuring and observing the performance and availability of the application, infrastructure, and services across the DevOps workflow. This helped us detect issues before they caused any major downtime for INSIGHT users. To personalize monitoring, the same monitoring stack was deployed to all staging and Production environments, allowing us to use the same tooling and troubleshooting techniques in all environments. All monitoring services are Dockerized and deployed as a monitoring stack. We used [Prometheus](http://insight.ifglabs.com:9090), cAdvisor, and Node Exporter to collect various metrics and [Grafana](http://insight.ifglabs.com:3000) as a dashboard to display reports. We used [Alertmanager](http://insight.ifglabs.com:9093), [Unseen](http://insight.ifglabs.com:9094), and an alert dashboard to send alerts to the team. [Weave Scope](http://insight.ifglabs.com:4041) was deployed to visualize the Docker Swarm cluster and container services in operation. We used Caddy as a proxy to provide authentication to all monitoring endpoints. 

Continuous Monitoring components can be viewed at the following locations:

* **Weave Scope:** http://insight.ifglabs.com:4041
* **Grafana:** http://insight.ifglabs.com:3000
* **Prometheus:** http://insight.ifglabs.com:9090
* **Alert Manager:** http://insight.ifglabs.com:9093
* **Unseen:** http://insight.ifglabs.com:9094

## r. Open Source Container
